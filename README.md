# ts_clean

## TODO
 - unit tests with mock db (dockerized psql)
 - logging for HTTP requests (express middleware)
 - logging for bussiness_logic (file)
 - database migrations organization:
 - - either heavily (like django with tables for keeping track of migrations)
 - - or lightly like organizing changes in .sql files (more work for the operator)
